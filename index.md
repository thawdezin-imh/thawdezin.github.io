### Hi, I'm **Thaw De Zin** (​သော်ဒီဇင်)

I am **Mobile Developer**. I love to develop Mobile applications using `SwiftUI`, `Flutter` and `Jetpack Compose`.
I am graduated from [University of Technology (Yatanarpon Cyber City)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology,_Yadanabon_Cyber_City) in `2020 Feb (4th Batch) before Coup`– B.E (Information Science and Technology).

### About Me

I've done my university projects using so many languages such as C, C++, Java, PHP, Python and MATLAB in the field of **Image, AI, Web, IoT, android, Big Data, High-performance computing, Web Scraping and Web Crawling.**

After graduated, I’ve decided to choose my career life as [Mobile Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thawdezin/) by applying the theory and technologies that I studied in University to Mobile development. For the programming, I’ve learned so many languages, even `Assembly (NASM)` with compiler design and structure. But I’m in love with `Flutter` and `Swift`. For the mobile development, I’m tightly couple with `Flutter`. If I have some free time, I spent by time with `Blockchain` and `Cryptocurrency` .
